This	project	uses an	API	from	the	Huffington	Post	that	provides	polling	information	for	
primaries,	elections,	and	various	topics.	It	focuses	on	the	Republican	(GOP)	candidates	for	the	
2016	Presidential	Election. When	the	application	loads,	it	retrieves	a	list	of	the	GOP and Democratic	candidates	and	uses	a	data	
visualization	library	called	D3.js	to	plot	a	bar	graph	of	each	candidateâ€™s	standing	in	the	polls
